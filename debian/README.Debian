Kimchi interface
----------------
Kimchi is now a plugin for Wok. Once installed, restart wok service and the
"Virtualization" tab should be showed after you log into Wok at
http://your_host:8001/wok.

Troubleshooting
---------------
Kimchi requires libvirtd service up and running. Check Wok log at
/var/log/wok/wok-error.log for possible reasons Kimchi is not loaded.
